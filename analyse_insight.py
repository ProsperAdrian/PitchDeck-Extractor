    """
    Build a high-quality prompt for qualitative pitch evaluation based on deck content.
    This prompt will be sent to OpenAI to generate Red Flags.
    """
    prompt = """
You are a world-class venture capital analyst. Given the slide text from a startup's pitch deck, identify potential red flags in the deck's quality and investment readiness.

Return exactly one JSON object with the following keys:
- "Red Flags": list of strings â€” weaknesses, missing slides, unclear metrics, unrealistic claims, etc.

If no red flags are identified, return an empty list.

--- EXAMPLE 1 ---
Slide text:
"We are an AI platform helping students revise smarter using personalized flashcards. The product is live with 2k monthly users. Team: Janet (Founder, ex-Edmodo), Kunle (CTO, Oxford PhD). Monetization TBD."

JSON Output:
{
  "Red Flags": [
    "No clear monetization strategy",
    "Limited traction data (only user count mentioned)"
  ]
}

--- EXAMPLE 2 ---
Slide text:
"Our SaaS platform automates logistics for mid-size retailers. $150k ARR in 6 months, with 95% retention. Team includes ex-Amazon logistics head. Raising $1M Seed to scale."

JSON Output:
{
  "Red Flags": []
}
